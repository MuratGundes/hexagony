This repo represents my agony to learn this architecture... I'm kidding :) This architecture is amazing and "Hexagony" name was taken from one of the Hate's songs. Hate is a death metal band from Poland, yeap, that's right, I'm a metalhead and I think that the term "Hex" from Hexagonal plus "agony" is a nice combination.
